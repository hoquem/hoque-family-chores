# CODEOWNERS
# This file designates default reviewers for pull requests.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.

# Default owner for all files in the repository.
# This ensures that any change, regardless of the file,
# will require a review from @hoquem when a PR targets a protected branch (e.g., main)
# configured with "Require review from Code Owners".
