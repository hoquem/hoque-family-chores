# Implementation Summary

This document describes the main engineering work completed in the **feat/mock-data-testing-setup** branch and provides guidance for ongoing project hygiene and CI/CD enablement.

---

## 1. Project Clean-up & Branch Management

| Action | Result |
|--------|--------|
| Deleted all fully-merged local branches | Local repo reduced to `main` & active feature branches only |
| Created working branch `feat/mock-data-testing-setup` | All new code lives here; safe for PR review |
| Old remote branches scheduled for deletion | _(perform via GitHub UI once PR merged)_ |

### Recommended Workflow
1. Create feature branches from `main`.
2. Open Pull Request immediately ‚Äì leverage draft PRs for visibility.
3. Delete the branch in GitHub after merge (auto-deletion setting).

---

## 2. Environment-based Data Service Configuration

| Artifact | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `lib/services/environment_service.dart` | Detects runtime context (CI, tests, debug, release) and exposes flags: `useMockData`, `shouldConnectToFirebase`. |
| `lib/services/data_service.dart` | Abstract interface that formalises **all** data operations (auth, tasks, gamification, analytics). |
| `lib/services/mock_data_service.dart` | In-memory implementation backed by `lib/test_data/mock_data.dart`. |
| `lib/services/firebase_data_service.dart` | Production implementation using **Firebase Auth + Firestore**. |
| `lib/services/data_service_factory.dart` | Returns the correct implementation at runtime, honouring optional overrides. |

---

## 3. Mock vs Firebase Runtime Selection

| Scenario | Behaviour |
|----------|-----------|
| `flutter test` or CI build | `EnvironmentService.useMockData == true` ‚áí app swaps in `MockDataService` and completely skips Firebase initialisation. |
| Debug/release on simulator/device | `useMockData == false` ‚áí `Firebase.initializeApp()` then `FirebaseDataService`. |
| Manual override | Pass `forceMock/forceFirebase` to `DataServiceFactory.getDataService()` for edge-case testing. |

---

## 4. Testing Infrastructure

* Re-wrote `test/widget_test.dart` to cover:
  * Environment detection
  * DataServiceFactory correctness
  * Core MockDataService auth & task flows
* Added extensive test data set in `lib/test_data/mock_data.dart`.
* Network latency & ID generation simulated for realism.
* Tests create CI-friendly artefacts:
  * `test-results/flutter-test-results.json`
  * `test-results/lcov.info`
  * `test-results/summary.md` (human summary)

---

## 5. CI/CD Preparation

* Draft GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) created:
  * Matrix on **Ubuntu** with multiple Flutter versions.
  * Caches Flutter & pub packages.
  * Runs tests **with mock data only** and uploads artefacts.
  * Builds a release APK post-test.
* Workflow was **removed from commit** because current PAT lacks `workflow` scope.  
  ‚Üí Re-add after elevating token/using GitHub App.

---

## 6. Branch Protection Setup (GitHub)

| Setting | Recommendation |
|---------|----------------|
| Require pull-request reviews | ‚úîÔ∏è At least 1 approving review. |
| Require status checks | ‚úîÔ∏è `CI / test (ubuntu-latest, flutter-*)` must pass. |
| Require linear history | ‚úîÔ∏è Enforce rebase/merge. |
| Restrict who can push | Allow only admins & GitHub Actions bot. |
| Auto-delete merged branches | Enable for hygiene. |

Configure under **Repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Branches ‚Üí branch protection rules ‚Üí Add rule (`main`)**.

---

## 7. Future Steps & Usage Instructions

1. **Re-enable CI workflow**
   * Add the workflow file back.
   * Ensure PAT or GitHub App used by Factory has `workflow` scope.
2. **Address failing tests**
   * A few auth-flow assertions still need refinement (see current CI logs).
3. **Migrate additional Firestore collections**
   * Extend `FirebaseDataService` to cover remaining domain objects (badges, notifications history queries).
4. **Enable secret management**
   * Store `.env` values and Firebase configuration via GitHub secrets for release pipelines.
5. **Manual QA**
   * Run `flutter run` on device to verify Firebase connectivity and screens.
6. **Documentation**
   * Publish this summary in `README.md` or Wiki for new contributors.

### Quick Start for Developers

```bash
# get dependencies
flutter pub get

# run with real Firebase
flutter run

# run in-memory tests
flutter test

# force mock mode in debug
flutter run --dart-define=USE_MOCK_DATA=true
```

Happy coding! üéâ
