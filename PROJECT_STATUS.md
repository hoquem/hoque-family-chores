## 1. Repository Clean State
| Item | State |
|------|-------|
| Working tree | **Clean** (`git status` shows no uncommitted changes) |
| Active branch | `feat/mock-data-testing-setup` |
| Remote sync | Branch pushed ‚ûú `origin/feat/mock-data-testing-setup` (latest `93bcbf2`) |
| Merge conflicts | **None** (all conflicts resolved) |
| `.gitignore` | Properly excludes build artefacts, secrets, and platform files |
| CI workflow file | Removed until PAT with `workflow` scope is available |

---

## 2. Summary of All Changes (This Session)
1. **Environment-Aware Data Layer**
   * Added `EnvironmentService`, `DataService` interface, `MockDataService`, `FirebaseDataService`, and `DataServiceFactory`.
2. **Auth Provider Enhancement**
   * Full DataService-backed auth logic.
   * Compatibility layer (`currentUser`) for gamification screens.
3. **Gamification & Dashboard Merge**
   * Integrated widgets/providers from `main` with our environment setup.
4. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
   * Environment tests, auth tests, task tests, app boot test.
5. **CI/CD Foundation**
   * Draft GitHub Actions workflow prepared (not committed due to token scope).
6. **Merge Conflict Resolution**
   * Resolved conflicts in `main.dart`, dashboard, auth provider, widget tests.
7. **Build & Simulator Run**
   * Successfully built for iOS simulator; app runs with real Firebase.
8. **Documentation**
   * Added `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (dev guide) earlier in session.
9. **Project Hygiene**
   * Deleted merged branches locally, created feature branch, auto-pushed.

## 3. Build & Test Status
| Stage | Result | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `flutter pub get` | ‚úÖ | All dependencies resolved |
| `flutter analyze` | ‚ö†Ô∏è | 55 warnings/infos (mostly unused imports, deprecations) |
| **Unit / Widget tests** | ‚ö†Ô∏è *11 passed ¬∑ 3 failed* | Failures due to timer cleanup & auth flow expectation |
| `flutter build ios --simulator` | ‚úÖ | Built `Runner.app` in ~35 s |
| `flutter run` on *iPhone 16 Plus* | ‚úÖ | App launched, Firebase initialised |

Artifacts (`build/ios/iphonesimulator/Runner.app`) verified.

## 4. Ready for Production
| Area | Status |
|------|--------|
| Core Architecture (DataService, Env detection) | **Ready** |
| Auth Flows (sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, reset) | **Ready** |
| Firebase Integration (Auth + Firestore) | **Ready** (tested) |
| Dashboard UI / Gamification Widgets | **Functional**, polishing needed |
| CI/CD pipeline | **Draft ready**, needs token scope |
| Tests | **Baseline ready**, fix remaining 3 failures before enforcing |

---

## 5. Recommended Next Steps
1. **Fix Remaining Tests**
   * Address timer assertion & authentication expectation failures.
2. **Enable GitHub Actions**
   * Re-add `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; update PAT or use GitHub App with `workflow` scope.
3. **Code-Quality Pass**
   * Resolve `flutter analyze` warnings (unused imports, deprecated APIs).
4. **Branch Protection**
   * Activate on `main`: require PR review + passing CI.
5. **Secret Management**
   * Move `.env` & Firebase configs to GitHub secrets for release workflows.
6. **Performance QA**
   * Verify on real devices (iOS & Android) with production Firebase.
7. **Documentation**
   * Merge `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` into project wiki/readme.

## 7. Minor Cleanup Items
* Remove stray `.DS_Store` in platform folders (ignored, but can delete).
* Replace deprecated `withOpacity` calls.
* Trim unused imports flagged by analyzer.
* Consolidate mock services (Task, Leaderboard, etc.) under `lib/test_data/` for clarity.
* Add **GamificationServiceFactory** to mirror `DataServiceFactory` and allow environment switching.
